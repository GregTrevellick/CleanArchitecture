SYNC WITH UPSTREAM
==================

clone/get ardalis latest version 

build ardalis latest version (to prove it does)

run the vsix, create a new sln, compare ardalis to trevellick - should be SOME diffs

if lots of diffs replace my \src & \tests & CleanArchitecture.sln with Steve's more up to date versions (will reduce or eliminate conflicts)

git remote -v // List the current configured remote repository for your fork (ardalis not listed)

git remote add upstream https://github.com/ardalis/cleanarchitecture.git // Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.

git remote -v // Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork (ardalis is listed)

git fetch upstream // updates in remote upstream will be fetched to local repo in "upstream/master"

git merge upstream/master // merge the changes in upstream/master into your local master branch

resolve merge conflicts

Hint: Solution Items\template.json defines the projects included in the solution

build trevellick CleanArchitecture.Vsix.sln (to prove it does)

build trevellick CleanArchitecture.sln (to prove it does) 

run all unit tests (in CleanArchitecture.Vsix.sln)

run the website & smoke test it

Update version number in source.extension.vsixmanifest, set vsixTemplatePackSideWaffle.csproj as start up project, run the vsix, create a new sln, build & run locally, run unit tests locally, compare ardalis to trevellick - should be NO diffs

Publish to marketplace (via VsmpPublish.ps - inc. update version number and create github release), upgrade in VS, create a new sln from the published vsix, compare to ardalis - should be NO diffs

Hint: refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/dotnetcore.yml` without `workflow` scope Fix: within the fork, add the same GitHub Action file (.github\workflow\blah.yml) as the upstream Also: https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/
